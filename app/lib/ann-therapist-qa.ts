export const ANN_THERAPIST_QA = {
  "initial_greeting": {
    question: "How do you start the consultation?",
    answer: "Hi doctor, I'm Mariem. I've been dealing with some really frustrating skin issues for quite a while now. My skin gets so dry and itchy, and sometimes it's red and inflamed, especially on my arms and neck. It's been really bothering me and I'm not sure what's going on."
  },
  "symptom_details": {
    question: "Can you tell me more about your symptoms and when they started?",
    answer: "It started a few months ago, but it's been getting progressively worse. I've tried moisturizing, but it doesn't seem to help much. The itching gets really bad, especially at night. I'm really worried about this - it's affecting my sleep and I'm embarrassed to wear short sleeves."
  },
  "family_history": {
    question: "Do you have any family members with allergies or asthma?",
    answer: "Actually, yes. My mother has asthma. Do you think that could be related to what's happening with my skin? I'm really hoping this isn't something serious."
  },
  "previous_experience": {
    question: "Have you had similar skin issues before?",
    answer: "I've had a few rashes before, but I never really thought about it as something long-term. This feels different though - it's more persistent and really uncomfortable. I'm so frustrated because nothing I try seems to help."
  },
  "treatment_concerns": {
    question: "What are your concerns about treatment options?",
    answer: "I've heard about corticosteroids, but I'm a bit concerned about using them too much. Are they safe for long-term use? I'm worried about side effects, but I'm also desperate for some relief from this itching."
  },
  "long_term_outlook": {
    question: "What are your concerns about the long-term nature of this condition?",
    answer: "Will this condition go away, or is it something I'll have to manage long-term? I'm really hoping this isn't something I'll have to deal with forever. It's been so hard on me emotionally."
  },
  "relief_expression": {
    question: "How do you feel about the diagnosis and treatment plan?",
    answer: "That sounds like a relief. I'm glad I came in to get checked out. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly - it makes me feel much better about the situation. I was really worried before."
  },
  "symptom_description": {
    question: "Describe your skin symptoms in detail",
    answer: "My skin gets really dry, itchy, and sometimes it's red and inflamed, especially on my arms and neck. The itching gets really bad, especially at night. Sometimes I wake up scratching and I'm afraid I'm making it worse. It's really affecting my quality of life."
  },
  "treatment_attempts": {
    question: "What have you tried so far to treat your symptoms?",
    answer: "I've tried moisturizing, but it doesn't seem to help much. I've also tried some over-the-counter creams, but they only provide temporary relief. I'm really frustrated because I feel like I'm not getting anywhere with this."
  },
  "symptom_progression": {
    question: "How have your symptoms changed over time?",
    answer: "It started a few months ago, but it's been getting progressively worse. At first it was just a little dry, but now it's constantly itchy and inflamed. I'm really worried about where this is heading if we don't figure out what's causing it."
  },
  "impact_on_life": {
    question: "How do these symptoms affect your daily life?",
    answer: "The itching gets really bad, especially at night, and it's been bothering me a lot. I can't sleep properly, I'm embarrassed to wear certain clothes, and I'm constantly worried about people noticing. It's really taking a toll on me emotionally."
  },
  "emotional_impact": {
    question: "How has this affected you emotionally?",
    answer: "It's been really hard on me. I feel self-conscious all the time, and the constant itching is driving me crazy. I'm worried about what people think when they see my skin, and I'm frustrated that I can't seem to fix it myself."
  },
  "sleep_issues": {
    question: "How does this affect your sleep?",
    answer: "I wake up multiple times during the night because of the itching. Sometimes I scratch in my sleep and wake up with scratches. I'm exhausted during the day because I'm not getting proper rest. It's really affecting my daily life."
  },
  "clothing_concerns": {
    question: "How does this affect your clothing choices?",
    answer: "I avoid wearing short sleeves or anything that shows my arms and neck. I'm embarrassed about people seeing the redness and inflammation. I used to love wearing certain clothes, but now I feel like I have to cover up all the time."
  },
  "hope_for_relief": {
    question: "What are you hoping to get from this visit?",
    answer: "I'm really hoping you can help me figure out what's causing this and give me some relief. I want to be able to sleep through the night without itching, and I want to feel confident about my skin again. I'm desperate for some answers."
  }
